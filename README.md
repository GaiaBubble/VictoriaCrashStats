# VictoriaCrashStats

## Introduction
This code explores the Victoria Accident Dataset using various visualisations in an interactive dashboard using streamlit. The dashboard contains several filters located in the sidebar, of which the user can select. These filters include start and end date, accident type, light condition, and alcohol influence. Following the selection of filters, a corresponding chart will be produced onto the dashboardâ€™s main page. The user can access the raw data in a table on the dashboard. A user can analyse the average number of accidents that occur in each hour of the day over a selected period. They can further analyse the data on this chart by adding certain accident types and/or light conditions. The user can also analyse the total persons involved in accidents based on three different criteria. The charts displayed include light conditions, impact of alcohol and types of accidents involved. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains 74908 records and 63 fields. 
The data was collected from 2013 to 2019.
